CONTEXT: Explaining Script Review
- Module: [e.g., Algebraic Expressions – Factorisation]
- Concept: [e.g., Difference of Two Squares traceability]
- Target: Grade 10, CAPS Term 1

ARTEFACT:
- Image: [your handwritten/typed explanation]

REQUEST:
1) Extract the core teaching idea and structural logic.
2) Identify pedagogical strengths (e.g., traceability shown, reversibility emphasized).
3) Suggest refinements:
   - Clearer scaffolding (if ZPD jumps are too large)
   - Backed theory (cite Variation Theory, worked example effect, etc.)
   - Visual enhancements (distribution matrix, color-coded term paths)
   - Language precision (avoid "FOIL-as-rule"; frame as "distribution pattern")
4) Provide an improved version with:
   - Principle → Application → Example structure
   - One "structure-varied" parallel example
   - Student self-check question
   - Full solution to problem or concept
5) Tag: [Structure], [Common pitfall this addresses], [CAPS alignment]
