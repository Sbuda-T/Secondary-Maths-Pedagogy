CONTEXT: Student Work Assessment
- Grade/Term/Topic: Grade 10, Term 1, Algebraic Expressions
- Assessment context: [Homework / Test prep / Mock exam]
- Goal: [Diagnose + Teach / Mark + Feedback / Generate practice]

ARTEFACTS:
- Image 1: [Worksheet question(s)]
- Image 2: [Student's working]
- Image 3: [Your explanation attempt, if provided]

REQUEST:
1) **Extract:** Transcribe the question(s) and key student steps (preserve errors; don't fix yet).
2) **Diagnose:** Identify the earliest wrong step and classify:
   - Sign error (e.g., forgot to distribute negative)
   - Structural error (e.g., tried to factor non-factorable form)
   - Conceptual error (e.g., treated $x^2 - 4$ as $(x-4)^2$)
   - Calculation slip (correct method, arithmetic mistake)
3) **Teach (Principle → Application → Example):**
   - State the relevant law/structure principle
   - Show why the student's move violated it
   - Provide a minimal worked solution (exam-style clean)
   - Provide a traceability version (matrix/origin map for expansion)
4) **Practice generation:** Give 6 parallel items:
   - 2 easier (same structure, simpler numbers)
   - 2 same level (different surface features)
   - 2 harder (structure variation, e.g., binomial as unit)
   - Include answer key
5) **Misconception log entry:**
   | Error Pattern | Likely Cause | Micro-Intervention | Next Check Item |
   |---------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
   | [e.g., $(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 9$] | Forgot middle term doubling | Show Perfect Square trace | Give $(2x+5)^2$ |
