# Grade 10 Mathematics Pedagogical Framework  
**Assessment-first | Structure-aware | Diagnostic-driven**

Welcome to the **Secondary Maths Pedagogy** repository.  
This site documents a **Grade 10 Mathematics teaching framework**, designed to support **immediate assessment preparation** while scaling into a **full CAPS-aligned pedagogy** over the academic year.

## 🚨 PRIORITY 1: Test Preparation (Immediate)

**Context:**  
Grade 10 • Term 1 • Algebraic Expressions  
**Primary Goal:** Prepare for the upcoming assessment through structured revision, error diagnosis, and targeted practice.

### Focus Areas
- Identifying algebraic structure *before* manipulation  
- Expansion ↔ factorisation **reversibility**
- Eliminating common sign, structure, and conceptual errors

👉 Start here:  
- [Term 1 – Algebraic Expressions](syllabus/term1-algebraic-expressions/module-overview.md)

## 🧠 How This Pedagogy Works

This framework is built around **three core principles**:

1. **Structure First**  
   Students learn to classify expressions *before* operating on them.

2. **Traceability**  
   Every expansion can be traced back to its factorised origin.

3. **Early Error Detection**  
   Diagnose the *first* wrong step — not the final answer.
